<!-- Exercise

    Write a html document that has a div, span, h1-h6, p, and section content.
        Make the content of each tag type be appropriate to the tag. IE a p should have a small paragraph, a h1 should have a title type content.
        If you do not know what type of content is appropriate look it up on MDN. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
